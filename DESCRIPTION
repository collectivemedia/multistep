Title: Utilities for running, timing and logging a multi-step process from R
Version: 0.1
Author: Sergei Izrailev, Jeremy Stanley

Description: A common pattern in modeling and data analysis is running complex,
    primarily linear processes consisting of multiple steps.
    The multistep package provides wrapper functionality abstracting
    the timing and logging of these processes. It uses a relational
    database to record the processes as well as is capable of splitting
    standard output from the various steps in separate files. Conceptually,
    each run of a multi-step process consists of stages, which, in turn,
    consist of steps. The two-level hierarchy allows for logical groupings
    of steps in stages, and provides minimal functionality for controlling
    dependencies of stages on each other.
